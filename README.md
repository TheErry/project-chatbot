## The problem

We started with the labs and went through the material for this project. After that we started with the pair-programing and finished all the Iterations. We had problems with understanding how we could get our input-filed back after we had changed it to a select-menu. We approached the problem by asking about it in one of the lectures, at our demo time in our team and we also posted a question in stackoverflow. After that we could solve the problem. There were also a problem when we wanted to store our values so we could use them in our summary function. To be able to solve the problem we asked for help in slack. One our classmates responded and could help us figure it out. If we had more time we would have limited the foodamount function so it could only write a number instead of text. We would also have added more questions.
